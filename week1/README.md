# Menu Cards
This application aims to create a response restaurant menu using mainly CSS and HTML. I received the task to create this using no classes and no ids to target elements.

This is my first css project so i chose to not limit myself right away instead i would build first and pick restrictions later.

The restrictions i picked are:

[-] max 5kb

[-] no media quarys


# Concept
The concept is based on a deck of playing cards. When you scroll through the menu, the cards with on them the discs will present in a chain like fashion. On the left you see the food categories. with these buttons you are able to quickly jump to your favorite sub category.
